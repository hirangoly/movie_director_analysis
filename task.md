## Three tasks: 

   1. Produce a table of directors and the number of titles they directed. Order the table from highest number of titles directed to lowest number of titles directed.
   2. Produce a table of directors showing the total inflation adjusted gross (across all of the movies they directed) for each director. Ideally order the table from highest total inflation adjusted gross to lowest and show only the top 5 directors.
   3. Showing only directors who directed 5 or more titles, produce a table of mean inflation adjusted gross by director. Ideally, order the table from the highest inflation adjusted gross to lowest.
