2. List of directors showing the total inflation adjusted gross (across all of the movies they directed) for each director. Order the table from highest total inflation adjusted gross to lowest and show only the top 5 directors.
3. List of directors who directed 5 or more titles, produce a table of mean inflation adjusted gross by director. Ideally, order the table from the highest inflation adjusted gross to lowest.
